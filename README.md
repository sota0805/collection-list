[Read how to install composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix)

## How to Contribute



### Pull Requests

1. Fork this repository  
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement  
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **develop** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull  
request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

### Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) standard.

### Unit Testing

All pull requests must be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code coverage. The project uses  
`phpunit` for testing.
